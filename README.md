# Prediction of protein secondary structure from amino acid sequence - Bioinformatics approach

This is a repository for project 'Prediction of protein secondary structure from sequence by Hiddem Markov Model(HMM) method' for project in course 'MOL3022- Bioinformatics - Method Oriented Project' at NTNU, in spring 2019. 

Example files for reference 
1. hmmexample.py -- main file for predicting weather with comsumption of icecream (https://github.com/jason2506/PythonHMM)
2. weatherexample.py -- module file, same as 1.  " 
3. COMP3212CompBiologyLabs-master -- predicting genetic code from protein sequence (https://github.com/aloisklink/COMP3212CompBiologyLabs)

Main files
1. main.py -- to be updated after 8th Mar - 22nd Mar, 2019
2. hiddenmarkovmodel.py -- in updating until 22nd Mar, 2019
3. sequence.py -- in updating until 22nd Mar, 2019

Test files
